<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<b>What are the level codes between the levels?</b>

<p>When you complete a level, you will receive a level code with which you can skip to that level again in the future. On the main menu, you can click Resume and type in your level code there. Alternatively, you can use a level code from anywhere by pressing the Q key in the middle of a level.</p>

<p>Unless you have a good memory, make sure you write down the level codes for levels that you have enjoyed or may wish to go back to in the future.</p>

<b>The game is too difficult! Is there an easier mode?</b>

<p>The difficulty of the game increases rapidly with each level. If you are struggling with a particular maze, remember to think about the consequences of any action you take. "If I go through this door, will the cat be able to get me?"</p>

<b>Have you considered making the game 3D?</b>

<p>The extra effort it would require is enormous. We wanted to focus on the quality of the story and puzzles rather than fancy graphics. </p>

<b>Will the game work on mobile devices?</b>

<p>We have recently added onscreen controls for touchscreen devices. To enable these onscreen controls, tap the "Mobile Compatibility" button on the Play page.</p>

<b>Why don't the music and dialogue play properly on some devices?</b>

<p>Your browser might be intentionally preventing the sound from playing. Check to see whether Auto-Play is disabled for Mouse Trapped and allow it if necessary. If that doesn't help, you might have discovered an actual bug. Please tell us all about it.</p>
