<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<b>The game is too difficult! Is there an easier mode?</b>

<p>You're probably talking about the level with all the buttons. Watch the sparkles, and you'll be fine. </p>

<b>Have you considered making the game 3D?</b>

<p>The extra effort it would require is enormous. We wanted to focus on the quality of the story and puzzles rather than fancy graphics. </p>

<b>Will the game work on mobile devices?</b>

<p>Probably not. At the moment, the only way of moving the mouse is with a keyboard, and it is not practical to do this on a small screen with a virtual keyboard. In theory, we could probably enable swipe-to-move, or even port the game to an iOS app, but we're not going to.</p>

<b>Why does the game freeze when a cutscene starts?</b>

<p>Your browser might be intentionally preventing the video from playing. Check to see whether Auto-Play is blocked and disable it if necessary. If that doesn't help, you might have discovered an actual bug. Please tell us all about it.</p>
