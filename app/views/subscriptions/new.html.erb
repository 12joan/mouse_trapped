<h1>Notify Me</h1>

<p>Although we have already sumbitted the game's application to the Young Game Designers competition, development is by no means finished. It is entirely possible that we will release another level, upload a new cutscene or make an improvement to the graphics in the future. Enter your email address here to receive notifications when we make such an improvement. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in one of the emails.</p>

<p>If you found out about this game from another player, they may have given you a seven-digit code. If you're feeling nice, please type this code in along with your email address to give your friend easy access to the latest levels. Whether you do so or not will have no effect on your own gameplay.</p>
