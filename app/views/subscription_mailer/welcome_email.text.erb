Unlike many automated emails, this is not from a no-reply address. There are actual, real humans just a Reply button away, so why not show your appreciation, express your discontent or query our brains with some feedback. The more positive reviews we get, the more motivated we will be to design new levels and artwork; the more useful criticism we receive, the better this content will become. 

If you would prefer not to receive these emails, please follow the link below.
