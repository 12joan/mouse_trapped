Many statisticians say that there are never more than six degrees of separation between any two people in the world. If you are enjoying Mouse Trapped, then why not help to spread the word? If everyone who receives this email tells everyone they know about the game, and if each of those people does the same, then Mouse Trapped will become very popular very quickly. 

To help, you can share the URL of our website on social media or directly to friends and colleagues. After they've had a chance to try the game, remind them to subscribe to new level notifications so that they remain interested, and hopefully do their part to spread the word when we ask them to. 

We won't send self-promotion emails like this one often - about once for every five or six levels we create. I think that's a fair trade-off for a free game, don't you? 

Unlike many automated emails, this is not from a no-reply address. There are actual, real humans just a Reply button away, so why not show your appreciation, express your discontent or query our brains with some feedback. The more positive reviews we get, the more motivated we will be to design new levels and artwork; the more useful criticism we receive, the better this content will become. 

You're receiving this because you subscribed to email notifications about new levels and other important milestones in Mouse Trapped's developmet.
