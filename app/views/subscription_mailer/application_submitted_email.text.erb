Mouse Trapped Young Game Designers Application Submitted

As you may have read from the website, Mouse Trapped was originally developed for the BAFTA Young Game Designers competition, the deadline for which is 17:00 Wednesday 25 April. Our application has now been submitted; we expect to hear the outcome at the start of June.

As part of the application, we had to produce a short video promoting the game. Here’s a link to it on Google Drive.

Now that the game’s original purpose has been completed, we need to decide whether to continue maintaining and adding to the game. Whether we do so or not will primarily depend upon the feedback we receive from our users.

If you have enjoyed Mouse Trapped, then now is the time to let us know. Before you do anything else, click the reply button, type either “Yes” or “No” in the subject field and press send. If you’re feeling especially helpful, then write a sentence or two explaining your choice.

Unlike many automated emails, this is not from a no-reply address. There are actual, real humans just a Reply button away, so why not show your appreciation, express your discontent or query our brains with some feedback. The more positive reviews we get, the more motivated we will be to design new levels and artwork; the more useful criticism we receive, the better this content will become.
