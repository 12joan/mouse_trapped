# Mouse Trapped

Mouse Trapped was originally developed for the BAFTA Young Game Designers competition, in which coders, artists and story writers design their own video games. They may either focus on the concept or actually produce the game. As you can see, we have done the latter.

In the game, you navigate the mouse around a set of mazes of rapidly increasing difficulty which appear to have no end. You receive no sympathy from the scientist, who barely acknowledges that you are any more important than a glass beaker. After all, if you break, he can always get a new one.

## Play online

Mouse Trapped is available to play online at www.mousetrapped.co.uk. 

## Bring your own server

If you're feeling brave, you can download the source code and host the game yourself on a localhost server. Navigate to the index.html page in a browser and enjoy the negligible loading times!
